## How to make one

You need a CAM Processor (e.g. CamBam) and a CNC in order to create the arm. The arm is designed with precise measurements of the original DJI plastic arm. 

The unit is mm. For any modifications you would need Adobe Illustrator or a compatible program that can be able to process DXF files.
